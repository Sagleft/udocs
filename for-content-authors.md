# For content authors

If you have your own community, who read your posts on social media, you can **bring this audience to Utopia** by creating your own channel.

All you have to do is publish content to this channel and receive payments in UUSD every month! Payments are calculated based on the number of subscribers you bring.

**In addition, there are additional ways to monetize your audience:**

* Accept donations in CRP or UUSD.
* Offer your goods or services to subscribers and accept payment for them.
* Mention others in your channel for a fee.
* Post paid comments from your subscribers in the channel so that they can say something to the whole community.
