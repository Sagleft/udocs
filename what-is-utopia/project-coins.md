This is a coin that is used to buy domain names (uNS - Utopia Name System). By buying CRP you become a shareholder of the project. The better a project becomes known, the more the community is engaged in its development, the higher the potential growth of the coin.

Also used in games. You can gather your friends to play crypto poker in Utopia and bet in CRP.

### UUSD (Utopia USD) - The world's first truly untraceable stablecoin
