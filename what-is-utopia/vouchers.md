# Vouchers

_Example of a voucher: UTP-D6JB-3N2K-Y4ZF-L7O5-EAMT_

You can create one-time vouchers in your wallet. It is possible to batch create multiple vouchers for a fixed amount at once.

A voucher is a convenient format to send coins offline. You can also use them to attract users to your channel who are not yet Utopia users.
